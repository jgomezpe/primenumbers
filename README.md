Programs for prime number generation and analysis
<ul>
<li> sieve.cpp: Computes Sieve of Eratosthenes considering only odd numbers and going from p^p to N incremens of 2p. Operations are at bit level when possible, for example 2p = (p<<1). An array of int is used for storing odd number marks of primality. Therefore, and array of M integers can store up to 64*M primality marks. </li>
