# Prime Numbers
Programs for prime number generation and analysis
<ul>
<li> <b>sieve.cpp</b>: Computes the Sieve of Eratosthenes considering only odd numbers and starting the counter in <i>p^p</i> ending at <i>N</i> with an increment of <i>2p</i>. Operations are at bit level when possible, for example <i>2p = (p<<1)</i>. An array of int is used for storing odd number marks of primality. Therefore, and array of M integers can store up to 64*M primality marks.

<li> <b>onprimorials.cpp</b>: Program for analyzing primorial numbers: Primorial Sets, Primorial Intervals, Primorial tables, Primorial totatives, Primorial admissible tuples, and Goldback conjectures. This program is part of the paper 'On Primorial Numbers' written by Professor Jonatan Gomez and available at ArXiv repository.

<li> <b>PNTprimorials.py</b>: Computes the Prime Number Theorem approximations using primorial numbers and primorial totatives, as proposed by professor Jonatan Gomez in the paper 'Prime Numbers Theorem and Primorial Numbers' available at Arxiv repository.
