# Prime Numbers
Programs for prime number generation and analysis
<ul>
<li> <b>sieve.cpp</b>: Computes the Sieve of Eratosthenes considering only odd numbers and starting the counter in <i>p^p</i> ending at <i>N</i> with an increment of <i>2p</i>. Operations are at bit level when possible, for example <i>2p = (p<<1)</i>. An array of int is used for storing odd number marks of primality. Therefore, and array of M integers can store up to 64*M primality marks.
